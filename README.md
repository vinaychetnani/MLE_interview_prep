# Machine Learning Interview Guide: 11 Essential Topics
---

*This guide is based on real interview experiences with top tech companies and aims to help ML engineers prepare more effectively for their career transitions.*

## Introduction

I have interviewed for Machine Learning roles extensively at big techs, mid tier companies and upcoming GenAI and ML startups. I managed to bag offers from companies such as Meta, Google, Spotify, Booking.com, Canva to name a few. 

Through this intensive process, I've gathered valuable insights that could be incredibly useful to many ML engineers in their journey to become better practitioners.

I've tried to identify all the major topics that I had to prepare for these interviews, and it's entirely possible that you might not be working with all these topics in your day-to-day work. Here's the comprehensive list of topics that I prepared for during my interview journey.

## The Reality of ML Interviews

Unlike Software engineering, which has a structured and mature interview process across the industry, the ML engineer landscape and interview processes are not standardized across the industry and are still in the nascent stage. Every company has something different in its interview cycles. However, after going through numerous interviews, I've managed to encapsulate all the essential preparations into 11 core topics.

**Important note:** You don't need to prepare for all topicsâ€”it depends on the company you're interviewing for and the specific domain (Computer Vision, NLP, GenAI) you're targeting.

If you're an ML practitioner looking for a switch or a software engineer looking to make a transition into Machine Learning, you would need to prepare for these topics

## ðŸŽ¯ The 11 Essential Topics

### [1. Generative AI, NLP, LLMs](gen_ai/genai.md)

With the industry-wide shift toward GenAI integration, companies are increasingly prioritizing candidates who can navigate the complexities of large language models, natural language processing, and generative systems. This domain has evolved from nice-to-have to absolutely essential for competitive ML roles.

### [2. Recommendation Systems](recsys/recsys.md)

These ubiquitous engines power the core user experience across virtually every consumer-facing platform. Given their critical business impact and technical complexity, recommendation systems consistently surface as a focal point in ML engineering interviews, requiring a deep understanding of both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.

### [3. Classical ML + Deep Learning](all_ML_concepts/ml_all.md)

Mastery across the entire ML spectrum, from foundational algorithms like Linear Regression and ensemble methods like Boosting Trees to sophisticated Neural Network architectures, demonstrates the breadth that interviewers seek. This comprehensive knowledge forms the backbone of ML engineering competency.

### [4. Tensor Manipulation](tensor_manipulation/tensor_manipulation.md)

Fluency in tensor operations using NumPy or PyTorch serves as a practical test for hands-on ML experience. Interviewers frequently evaluate your ability to efficiently manipulate multi-dimensional arrays, as this skill directly translates to real-world model implementation capabilities.

### [5. PyTorch](pytorch/pytorch.md)

As the dominant framework in modern ML development, PyTorch proficiency has become indispensable. Basic familiarity with implementing, training, and evaluating ML models is required, as interviewers often test PyTorch basics through live coding exercises.

### [6. Pandas](pandas_tutorial/pandas.md)

The cornerstone of data manipulation in Python, Pandas expertise is crucial for ETL pipeline development. Interviewers assess your ability to perform basic data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation operations that form the foundation of any robust ML workflow.

### [7. Python](python/python.md)

Advanced Python proficiency extends far beyond basic syntax. Interviewers expect a sophisticated understanding of object-oriented principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism), concurrency patterns (multi-threading, multi-processing), functional programming constructs (lambda functions, comprehensions), and efficient data handling mechanisms (generators, iterators).

### [8. ML System Design](ml_system_design/ml_sys_design.md)

This encompasses the architectural thinking required to design comprehensive end-to-end systems from initial data collection through production deployment. The scope includes discussions around:

- Feature engineering pipelines and data-to-features transformation strategies
- Model architecture selection and feature ingestion mechanisms
- Data imbalance mitigation techniques and sampling strategies
- Business KPI alignment with technical evaluation metrics for holistic performance assessment
- Production deployment orchestration using containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Comprehensive post-deployment monitoring and observability frameworks

### [9. System Design](system_design/sys_design.md)

Beyond traditional system design principles, ML-specific infrastructure requires a nuanced understanding of scalable model serving architectures. This involves mastering conventional distributed systems concepts (database selection and scaling, load balancing strategies, cache invalidation patterns, asynchronous processing) while additionally navigating:

- Robust data storage solutions for both raw and processed datasets
- Feature pipeline orchestration through real-time streaming and batch processing frameworks
- Feature store architecture for consistent feature serving across training and inference
- ML model registry systems for version control and checkpoint management
- Automated model retraining workflows and validation pipelines
- Production debugging methodologies for performance degradation analysis. For example - checking for training inference skew in feature values, etc

### [10. Big Data/Data Pipelines (SQL)](sql_bigdata/sql_bigdata.md)

In our data-driven ecosystem, the ability to architect and optimize large-scale data processing systems has become fundamental. This expertise encompasses:

- SQL proficiency for complex multi-table joins, aggregations, and data transformations
- Deep understanding of distributed computing frameworks, particularly Apache Spark's internal mechanics and optimization strategies
- Knowledge of data partitioning, sharding strategies, and distributed query execution patterns
- Specialized techniques like HyperLogLog algorithms for handling skewed join operations in Spark
- Statistical sampling methodologies, such as TABLESAMPLE, for data quality validation without full dataset processing

### [11. DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)](data_structures/ds.md)

The algorithmic foundation remains critical, particularly in LeetCode-intensive interview formats. Through four years of competitive programming experience, I've discovered that success lies not in rote memorization of data structures but in pattern recognition and contextual application.

The learning process is similar to when we are preparing for GRE/GMAT. Using word cards to learn new words helps in knowing new words, but we won't be able to use them in our vocabulary until we encounter them within meaningful contexts (articles, conversations, literature), for our mind to understand the context in which they occur and understand and learn those patterns implicitly. The same is true with Data Structures and employing them to solve problems. This contextual understanding enables the implicit pattern recognition that separates proficient problem-solvers.
